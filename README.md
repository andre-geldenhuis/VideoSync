This VideoSync web application automatically synchronizes and combines personal and crowd-sourced YouTube video clips to recreate a live concert experience from multiple angles. Video alignment is determined by applying signal processing methods to the audio portion of the file and uses time-frequency constellation analysis to determine when the songs overlap.

This project utilizes JavaScript, YouTube Player API, HTML5, and Bootstrap for front end development and Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy for the back end and signal processing algorithms.
